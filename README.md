# Numeric-Guessing-Game
Я только начинаю изучать python и вот решил сделать мини проект 'Числовая угадайка'
Let's explain the game to you:
The game generates a random number between {one_number} and {two_number} (inclusive!)
and asks you to guess this number. Also, if the number you entered is greater or less than the hidden number,
then the game will give you a hint. And at the end of the game, the number of attempts for which you tried to guess the number will be displayed.
